I started off the first week of the project trying to come with with something original.
Everything I came up with ended up being a bit out of my league, at least time-wise, so
I ended up caving and going for the space invader alterations. After feeling pretty solid
with everything from the tutorial visit I started modding. The changes I made were to add
elite enemies that take two hits to kill that have their numbers increased at different 
score values. The speed of enemies will also increase at different score values. then I 
added a weapon upgrade just a little before the score will trigger a boss to spawn that
takes 5 hits to kill, winning the game and pausing the enemy movement.

a particular struggle was getting the elite enemies to take more than one hit to kill. Everything
was running fine, but the elite enemies had become immortal and I was going a bit crazy
trying different things to make it work... I had simply forgotten a pair of brackets somewhere.

An issue I was unable to resolve was something I had written off as something easy that
I could pretty much copy and paste in. I couldn't get the "You Win" text to appear on the 
screen for more than a flash even though, as far as I can tell, it should have been roughly
the same as the gameover function. So the game just kind of awkwardly ends with the enemies
frozen on the screen.

The whole thing was fun. Really shows that making games is possible... if not very hard.

I had all the score unlock sped way up in this so the version on github takes a bit higher
score to progress.
